# Backtrack Community Edition Add-On
An Add-On for Minecraft Bedrock Edition

It's like a sparkly bed, but with a recall button.

Place a BACKTRACKER that acts as a restore point when you die. Each Backtracker is single-use

You can also throw down a JUMP PAD that, when stepped on, takes you to your most recent Backtracker.

The backtrack has a 15 second warm-up.

The Backtracker has an active state when placed and looks like a small iron gazebo with an industrial light spinning on top and sparks flicking out.

After use, the Backtracker becomes a rusted shell.

There's a warm particle wash that marks the source and target backtrack locations, and chip tune sound effects when placing items or backtracking.

The Jump Pads are crafted with 3x IRON INGOTs and an EMERALD.

The Backtracker is crafted with 4x Jump Pads. This way the player is equipped to use the Backtracker before placing one.

The resources used reflect the blocks available in the Backtracker structure (iron trapdoors)

The GUIDE is crafted by naming a BOOK "Backtrack Guide" on an ANVIL (without the quotes)
